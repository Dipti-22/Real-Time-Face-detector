This project is developed using Machine learning with MATLAB, here the face is detected using cascade object detector in vision library of MATLAB and the respective photo is taken using the snapshot funtion provided by the computer vision module in the MATLAB.


## Project Woking
Whenver the person whose data is stored in the database is detected, the name of the person will be given on the screen. In this project I have trained my model to detect two people. Whereas the model capacity is to detect 1000 people.
